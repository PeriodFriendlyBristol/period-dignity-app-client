            Bristol has pledged to take a leading role in making period products
            available to all who need them, while also combating outdated
            attitudes to periods.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Period Friendly Places vision is for Bristol to be a city of
            period dignity, in which nobody is held back in life or stigmatised
            against simply for having a period â€“ this is part of our journey to
            being a period friendly city.
